# Data Base Management System

I would like to give credit to Mohammad Faizan and Ahmed Abdurehman for their hard work and dedication to this project. Faizan's contributions to the implementation of BTrees were crucial to the success of the project, and Ahmed's work on AVL Trees was equally valuable. Their efforts, along with my own work on Red Black Trees, resulted in a successful project that would not have been possible without their contributions.
